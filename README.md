# Use of Nested-Loop in C++
## Aim
To study and implement decision-making statements and loop structures in C++, specifically:
- for loops
- while loops
- do-while loops
 ## Theory
Loops are repetitive control structures that streamline code execution by iterating over a block multiple times. This reduces redundancy and improves code readability.
ðŸ”„ Types of Loops:
- for loop â€“ Used when the number of iterations is predetermined.
- while loop â€“ Used when the number of iterations is unknown and based on a condition.
- do-while loop â€“ Similar to while, but guarantees one execution before condition checking.
 
## Functions Used
- main() â€“ Entry point of the C++ program.
- cout â€“ For displaying output.
- cin â€“ For user input.
- Loop control variables like i, j, k, and n to manage iteration behavior.
- Conditional expressions for determining loop continuation.
   ## Tools Used
- IDE/Compiler: GNU Compiler Collection (g++) or equivalent C++ compiler
- Environment: Command Line Terminal / IDE for compiling and running code
- Language: C++
- Header: #include<iostream>
- Namespace: using namespace std
-  ### For Loop
- Purpose: Used when the number of iterations is predetermined.
- Structure: Consists of initialization, condition, and update in one line.
- Behavior: Checks condition before every iteration.

### While Loop
- Purpose: Used when the number of iterations is uncertain and depends on runtime conditions.
- Structure: Only the condition is specified before the loop block.
- Behavior: Condition is checked before every execution.

### Do-While Loop
- Purpose: Ensures the loop runs at least once.
- Structure: Executes block first, then checks condition.
- Behavior: Useful when a minimum one-time execution is required regardless of condition.
## Conclusion
Loops are indispensable for automating repetitive tasks in C++.
- The for loop offers controlled iteration with predictable cycles.
- The while loop provides flexible repetition based on runtime conditions.
- The do-while loop ensures at least one execution regardless of condition.
